    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>

      In 1993, our founder, Jayprakash Gupta, arrived in the bustling city of Delhi with just ₹5000 in his pocket and a vision for the future. For six months, he explored various industries, learning the ins and outs of the business world before setting his sights on footwear materials. In October 1993, he secured an agency for rexene, a material essential for manufacturing sports shoes, marking the beginning of Mahalaxmi Overseas. With unwavering dedication, honesty, and perseverance, Jayprakash set a new benchmark for quality, establishing Mahalaxmi as a name synonymous with trust.
      <br>
      <br>
      In those early days, Jayprakash’s commitment to integrity was evident in every decision he made. On one occasion, he mistakenly charged a client higher prices. Unable to sleep that night, he recognized the importance of fairness and honesty in business. The very next day, he called the client, explained the misquote, and revised the prices to ensure complete transparency. This moment became a cornerstone of Mahalaxmi Overseas’ values, emphasizing that honesty and integrity are at the heart of everything we do.
      <br>
      <br>
      Over time, his commitment to quality propelled the company forward. In 2002, Mahalaxmi Overseas expanded its horizons by sourcing premium materials from countries like Italy, Taiwan, Korea, and China, introducing new and high-quality materials to the Indian market.
      <br>
      <br>
      In 2012, the journey continued when Nakul Gupta joined the family business, bringing youthful energy and fresh ideas. Nakul’s drive and dedication took Mahalaxmi to new heights, as he explored remote areas to source trendsetting materials that exceeded market expectations. Under his leadership, “one and one” truly became “eleven.”
      <br>
      <br>
      Today, Mahalaxmi Overseas stands as a trusted name in the footwear materials industry, driven by a legacy of honesty, quality, and a relentless pursuit of innovation. Our story is one of resilience, hard work, and a steadfast commitment to delivering the best for our clients. We’re proud of our journey and look forward to setting new standards for years to come.</p>
